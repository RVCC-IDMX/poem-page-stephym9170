Leavings is a poem written by Robin Robertson who is still alive by the way, the poems scene is based upon the wintertime and the snow. The photo uploadded by Tolu Olarewaju on the otherhand is just a photo with footprints in the snow, I called them footsetps on the page due to the fact that it gives it a little flair.
