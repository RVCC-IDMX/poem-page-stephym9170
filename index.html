      <h2>The Poem</h2>
      <p>
        Still sleepwalking through her life, I wrap her up and we go through the
        snow that fell all night and all through this Christmas morning:
      </p>

      <p>
        her trainers barely denting the whitened lawn, her two strides for every
        stride of mine.
      </p>
      <p>
        Leaving her home to the warmth of the house I step back out, and see
        where my footprints turn and walk through hers, the other way—following
        the trail of rabbit and deer into the unreachable silences of snow. I
        can bring nothing of this back intact.
      </p>
      <p>My face is smoke, my body water, my tracks are made of snow.</p>
      <p>
        The next morning is a dripping thaw, and winter is gone from the
        grass—except for a line of white marks going nowhere:
      </p>
      <p>
        the stamped ellipses of impacted snow; everything gone, leaving just
        this, this ghost-tread, these wafer-thin footsteps of glass.
      </p>
